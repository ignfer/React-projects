# Dynamic item list 🍎

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignfer/React-projects/main/01-01-ArrayState-useRef-Create-items/preview.png)

# Description 
In this small project we create new items and add them to the list to be rendered , we manage up to 3 simple states, conditional rendering and I've had to research about how can I keep track of an Array's status. Try it! just write something on the textfield and click Add to the list we will pick a random emoji and keep the count.
