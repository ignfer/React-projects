# Toggle-things

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignfer/React-projects/main/01-02-toggle-dark-mode-and-language/preview.png)

# Description
The main idea here was allow you to experiment with a very simple yet highly interactive web page! This application demonstrates how to dynamically switch between different states, controlling both the language (English or Spanish) and the display mode (light mode or dark mode) using toggle button components and the power of React.
