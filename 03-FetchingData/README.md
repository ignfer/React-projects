# 03 - Fetching data and useEffect
[demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignfer/React-projects/main/03-FetchingData/src/assets/demo.gif)

### The main purpose of this small project was to <strong>retrieve data from a REST API hosted on Heroku</strong>, the JSON response obtained from this API contains <strong>Legal Advisors and their respective clients.</strong>Throughout the development process, I delved into various tools and concepts, most notably the <strong>useEffect</strong> hook a skill I had long  aspired to acquire. Additionally, I gained proficiency in working with <strong>promises and the fetch API</strong>, augmenting my ability to seamlessly <strong>connect the frontend with external services or my own backend.</strong> This <strong>hands-on experience</strong> not only broadened my understanding of these technologies but also enhanced my  capacity to navigate and integrate external data into my projects effectively.
