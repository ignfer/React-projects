# 01 - ToDo list - useState & useRef

The main objective of this small app is to get used to <strong>React</strong> and the concept of states, hooks, and reusable components. To spend time on the important things we will work the whole development of this project on <strong>stackblitz</strong> wich provide us with a pre-configurated envivorment for developing on react and using <strong>Vite</strong>. We acomplished the task of creating reusable and reactive items, cycling throug an array of already declarated items, the next step is to be able to create  this components on demand and see if we could make the page react to that change
